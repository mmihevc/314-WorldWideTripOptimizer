# Preferences for _Kai Griem_

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * the easiest way to reach is me is by text and email between 9am-8pm

1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * i am not really certain what the material covered this semester will be. therefore my expectations of my team are to communicate effectively and work hard in pursuit of whatever the assingment is. 

1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * personally i would like to improve my coordination efforts with my team and attempt to structure our work effectively

1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * i imagine the two most obvious obstacles would be interpersonal conflict and struggling with the material

1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * this is a more nuanced issue than one person being in the right and the other being in the wrong. an understanding of extraneous circumstances would be necessary to make a judgement. one has to assume the person who wants a "B" is not an unrepentant slacker. 

1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * yes, see above answer

1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * this is highly variable depending on the difficulty of the assignment. 6 hours seems like a reasonable, albeit almost certainly innacurate, estimate. 

1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * i imagine we'll all get together and talk about it

1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * i would hope that effective communication would at least give our team a heads up on someone not finishing their work. if this is not the case all we can really do is cry and exchange strong words. 

1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * i imagine we'll have to talk about it

1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * we'll probably do the work and have a talk about it if it's becoming an issue ie. someone being a completely different schedule than everyone else

1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * depends on our ability to coordinate/work without it. i imagine we'll end up working together on weekends or something. 

1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * once a week-ish, possibly more

1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * depends on the gravity of the decision

1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * bend the English language to our will

1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * talk to the other team members and see what they think is appropriate. possibly just have a quick chat with the domineering person if it seems unintentional

1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * that's not gonna be a problem lmao

## Planned Epics

*Modify Itinerary*

The user will be able to make modifications to the current itinerary. This includes changing the starting point, reversing the order of the destinations, reordering individual destinations, and deleting destinations.

*Save*

The user will be able to save their current map and current trip itinerary. The map can be saved in either KML or SVG format, and the itinerary can be saved in either JSON or CSV format.

*Protocol Version 4*

We are responsible for updating the protocol version to version 4 alone with providing options in order for users to optimize their trips and itineraries with using the less distance traveled.

*Optimize*

The user will be able to request optimization on their itinerary along with applying a default level of optimization on the server that provides the best results along with allowing the option to select a certain level of optimization.

*Modify Desination*

The user will be able to modify the place attributes for a specific destination.

*Concurrency*

We are responisible for taking advantage of everything running at the same time to reduce computation time spent on optimization in order to provide the user with better results.

## Metrics

| Statistic | # Planned | # Completed |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Epics | 6 | *count* |
| Tasks | 28   | *count* | 
| Story Points |  30  | *sum* | 

Last sprint we created too many tasks from the beginning and were not able to get through them. This sprint we created less task with the hope that we will be able to complete more tasks during this sprint. During our last few sprints we rated every task with an estimate of 1 but this time we gave two tasks an estimate of 2. For this sprint we are tryint to be more aware ahead of time of the difficulty level a task will have. With the having a new member added to our team we hope to complete all of our tasks this sprint.

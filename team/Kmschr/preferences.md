1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Slack or Text from 9am-10pm

1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect the team to meet atleast the minimum requirements of the assignments but to also strive for good communication, practices, and timelyness.

1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I'd like to become a better communicator by being friendly, detail oriented, and understanding how to convey important information.

1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Every teammember has different schedules and this class might be on a different priority level for each member.

1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * Based on the guidelines presented in class, the people who want to get an "A" will put in more effort than the "B" people and as a result will probably score a higher grade.

1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * It's unideal from my perspective but acceptable.

1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I think it's reasonable to expect everyone to spend atleast 30mins to an hour everyday working on the project, but it might require more time depending on the amount of work needed to be completed.

1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * As a group based on personal interests, current workload, and prior knowledge.

1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * I would try and communicate with this person on why this happened and how to prevent it happening again. There are different methods if the problem escalates, but I don't expect that to be necessary.

1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * I'd try to reference the class guidelines and clean code book as a base guideline for quality.

1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * Keeping close commmunication on Slack and informing others on anticipated schedules.

1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I'd be able to meet after class and potentially on weekends.

1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Once to twice a week based on assignments.

1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * If the decision affects the entire team then I will communicate with the team babout it.

1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Ask that team member for clarification, but if no agreement comes then we must agree to disagree.

1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Make sure workload is being distributed evenly, and that the one person understands how the rest of the team feels.

1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Ask a team member to take over a certain role/general activity.

# Preferences for Maddie Mihevc

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * It's easier to reach me by text or slack between 9am and 11pm.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect my team to communicate effectively and get the assignments done in a timely manner.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I want to make sure when my team is communicating that I contribute to the conversation and contribute however I can to the
   best of my abilities. 
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * If a team member decides to stop communicating that will become an obstacle when trying to be effective. Also if all of us
   are unsure about how to complete a task that might hinder us.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I think we there are some team members who want to get an A then they are welcome to work a more on the assignment.
   However that shouldn't leave that person to carry the weight of the team.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I think as long as they aren't becoming a lone wolf or left to carry the weight of the team then they can do a little more
   work.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I tend to spend more time on assignments so I am hoping less than 10 hours a week.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * If someone has more experience in an area then they will take charge in the area. Otherwise we can probably decide on 
   who is interested in what.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * I would hope that if people would give the rest of the team a heads up ahead of time. I only feel like if it happens more
   then a couple times then the team should sit down and talk about what is going on.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * They will have to sit down and come to an agreement.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * I will try to accommodate how I work with the work habits of my teammates within reason. 
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I feel as long as we plan times to meet up during the week we don't need to have a standing meeting.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Depending on the week once or twice, maybe more.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * I think it depends on the decision being made. If it is going to drastically effect the assignment then the whole team
   should be involved otherwise I feel like they only need to approval of another teamate as long as they communicate what the
   decision is.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Try to reason with the person and understand why they don't agree and see if there is validity to their disagreement.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Use the strategies given to us for dealing with a lone wolf 
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I will reach out to my teammates to see if they can take over a task
